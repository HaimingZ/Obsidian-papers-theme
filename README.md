# obsidian-papers-theme
A simple yet delicate theme for the notetaking app Obsidian inspired by LaTeX editor and journal papers.

## Highlights

This theme focuses more on improving the writing experience via the following approaches:

- All lines are made equal in font size and height in order to make the edit mode experience close to writing on plain text. 
- Preview mode style is carefully designed. Researchers may find it similar to Elsevier journal papers. 
- Backlinks from a single note are grouped by a dark shade to avoid visual confusion.
- Andy Matuschak mode is activated by default.
- Scrollbars are made smaller to save screen space.
